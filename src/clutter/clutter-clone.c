/**
 * SECTION:clutter-clone
 * @short_description: An actor that displays a clone of a source actor
 *
 * #ClutterClone is a #ClutterActor which draws with the paint
 * function of another actor, scaled to fit its own allocation.
 *
 * #ClutterClone can be used to efficiently clone any other actor.
 *
 * <note><para>This is different from clutter_texture_new_from_actor()
 * which requires support for FBOs in the underlying GL
 * implementation.</para></note>
 *
 * #ClutterClone is available since Clutter 1.0
