/**
 * SECTION:clutter-stage
 * @short_description: Top level visual element to which actors are placed.
 *
 * #ClutterStage is a top level 'window' on which child actors are placed
 * and manipulated.
 *
 * Clutter creates a default stage upon initialization, which can be retrieved
 * using clutter_stage_get_default(). Clutter always provides the default
 * stage, unless the backend is unable to create one. The stage returned
 * by clutter_stage_get_default() is guaranteed to always be the same.
 *
 * Backends might provide support for multiple stages. The support for this
 * feature can be checked at run-time using the clutter_feature_available()
 * function and the %CLUTTER_FEATURE_STAGE_MULTIPLE flag. If the backend used
 * supports multiple stages, new #ClutterStage instances can be created
 * using clutter_stage_new(). These stages must be managed by the developer
 * using clutter_actor_destroy(), which will take care of destroying all the
 * actors contained inside them.
 *
 * #ClutterStage is a proxy actor, wrapping the backend-specific
 * implementation of the windowing system. It is possible to subclass
 * #ClutterStage, as long as every overridden virtual function chains up to
 * the parent class corresponding function.
