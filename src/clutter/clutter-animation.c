/**
 * SECTION:clutter-animation
 * @short_description: Simple implicit animations
 * @See_Also: #ClutterAnimatable, #ClutterInterval, #ClutterAlpha,
 *   #ClutterTimeline
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation is an object providing simple, implicit animations
 * for #GObject<!-- -->s.
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation instances will bind one or more #GObject properties
 * belonging to a #GObject to a #ClutterInterval, and will then use a
 * #ClutterAlpha to interpolate the property between the initial and final
 * values of the interval.
 *
 * The duration of the animation is set using clutter_animation_set_duration().
 * The easing mode of the animation is set using clutter_animation_set_mode().
 *
 * If you want to control the animation you should retrieve the
 * #ClutterTimeline using clutter_animation_get_timeline() and then
 * use #ClutterTimeline functions like clutter_timeline_start(),
 * clutter_timeline_pause() or clutter_timeline_stop().
 *
 * A #ClutterAnimation will emit the #ClutterAnimation::completed signal
 * when the #ClutterTimeline used by the animation is completed; unlike
 * #ClutterTimeline, though, the #ClutterAnimation::completed will not be
 * emitted if #ClutterAnimation:loop is set to %TRUE - that is, a looping
 * animation never completes.
 *
 * If your animation depends on user control you can force its completion
 * using clutter_animation_completed().
 *
 * If the #GObject instance bound to a #ClutterAnimation implements the
 * #ClutterAnimatable interface it is possible for that instance to
 * control the way the initial and final states are interpolated.
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation<!-- -->s are distinguished from #ClutterBehaviour<!-- -->s
 * because the former can only control #GObject properties of a single
 * #GObject instance, while the latter can control multiple properties
 * using accessor functions inside the #ClutterBehaviour::alpha_notify
 * virtual function, and can control multiple #ClutterActor<!-- -->s as well.
 *
 * For convenience, it is possible to use the clutter_actor_animate()
 * function call which will take care of setting up and tearing down
 * a #ClutterAnimation instance and animate an actor between its current
 * state and the specified final state.
 *
 * #ClutterAnimation is available since Clutter 1.0

 *
 * Animates the given list of properties of @actor between the current

 *                          "width", 100.0,

 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * will make width and height properties of the #ClutterActor "rectangle"
 * grow linearly between the current value and 100 pixels, in 250 milliseconds.
 *
 * The animation @mode is a logical id, either from the #ClutterAnimationMode
 * enumeration of from clutter_alpha_register_func().
 *
 * All the properties specified will be animated between the current value
 * and the final value. If a property should be set at the beginning of
 * the animation but not updated during the animation, it should be prefixed
 * by the "fixed::" string, for instance:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_SINE, 100,
 *                          "rotation-angle-z", 360.0,
 *                          "fixed::rotation-center-z", &amp;center,
 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * Will animate the "rotation-angle-z" property between the current value
 * and 360 degrees, and set the "rotation-center-z" property to the fixed
 * value of the #ClutterVertex "center".
 *
 * This function will implicitly create a #ClutterAnimation object which
 * will be assigned to the @actor and will be returned to the developer
 * to control the animation or to know when the animation has been
 * completed.
 *
 * If a name argument starts with "signal::", "signal-after::" or
 * "signal-swapped::" the two following arguments are used as callback
 * function and data for a signal handler installed on the
 * #ClutterAnimation object for the specified signal name, for
 * instance:
 *
 * |[
 *
 *   static void
 *   on_animation_completed (ClutterAnimation *animation,
 *                           ClutterActor     *actor)

 *                          "signal::completed", on_animation_completed, actor,
 *                          NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * The "signal::" modifier is the equivalent of using g_signal_connect();
 * the "signal-after::" modifier is the equivalent of using
 * g_signal_connect_after(); the "signal-swapped::" modifier is the equivalent
 * of using g_signal_connect_swapped(). The clutter_actor_animate() function
 * will not keep track of multiple connections to the same signal, so it is
 * your responsability to avoid them when calling clutter_actor_animate()
 * multiple times on the same actor.
 *
 * Calling this function on an actor that is already being animated
 * will cause the current animation to change with the new final values,
 * the new easing mode and the new duration - that is, this code:
 *
 * |[
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_LINEAR, 250,
 *                          "width", 100.0,

 *                          NULL);
 *   clutter_actor_animate (actor, CLUTTER_EASE_IN_CUBIC, 500,
