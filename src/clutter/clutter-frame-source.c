/**
 * clutter_frame_source_add_full:
 * @priority: the priority of the frame source. Typically this will be in the
 *            range between #G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT and #G_PRIORITY_HIGH.
 * @fps: the number of times per second to call the function
 * @func: function to call
 * @data: data to pass to the function
 * @notify: function to call when the timeout source is removed
 *
 * Sets a function to be called at regular intervals with the given
 * priority.  The function is called repeatedly until it returns
 * %FALSE, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and
 * the function will not be called again.  The @notify function is
 * called when the timeout is destroyed.  The first call to the
 * function will be at the end of the first @interval.
 *
 * This function is similar to g_timeout_add_full() except that it
 * will try to compensate for delays. For example, if @func takes half
 * the interval time to execute then the function will be called again
 * half the interval time after it finished. In contrast
 * g_timeout_add_full() would not fire until a full interval after the
 * function completes so the delay between calls would be 1.0 / @fps *
 * 1.5. This function does not however try to invoke the function
 * multiple times to catch up missing frames if @func takes more than
 * @interval ms to execute.
 *
 * Return value: the ID (greater than 0) of the event source.
 *
 * Since: 0.8
