/**
 * SECTION:clutter-actor
 * @short_description: Base abstract class for all visual stage actors.
 *
 * #ClutterActor is a base abstract class for all visual elements on the
 * stage. Every object that must appear on the main #ClutterStage must also
 * be a #ClutterActor, either by using one of the classes provided by
 * Clutter, or by implementing a new #ClutterActor subclass.
 *
 * Every actor is a 2D surface positioned and optionally transformed
 * in 3D space. The actor is positioned relative to top left corner of
 * it parent with the childs origin being its anchor point (also top
 * left by default).
 *
 * The actors 2D surface is contained inside its bounding box,
 * described by the #ClutterActorBox structure:
 *
 * <figure id="actor-box">
 *   <title>Bounding box of an Actor</title>
 *   <graphic fileref="actor-box.png" format="PNG"/>
 * </figure>
 *
 * The actor box represents the untransformed area occupied by an
 * actor. Each visible actor that has been put on a #ClutterStage also
 * has a transformed area, depending on the actual transformations
 * applied to it by the developer (scale, rotation). Tranforms will
 * also be applied to any child actors. Also applied to all actors by
 * the #ClutterStage is a perspective transformation. API is provided
 * for both tranformed and untransformed actor geometry information.
 *
 * The 'modelview' transform matrix for the actor is constructed from
 * the actor settings by the following order of operations:
 * <orderedlist>
 *   <listitem><para>Translation by actor x, y coords,</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Translation by actor depth (z),</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Scaling by scale_x, scale_y,</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Rotation around z axis,</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Rotation around y axis,</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Rotation around x axis,</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Negative translation by anchor point x,
 *   y,</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Rectangular Clip is applied (this is not an operation on
 *   the matrix as such, but it is done as part of the transform set
 *   up).</para></listitem>
 * </orderedlist>
 *
 * An actor can either be explicitly sized and positioned, using the
 * various size and position accessors, like clutter_actor_set_x() or
 * clutter_actor_set_width(); or it can have a preferred width and
 * height, which then allows a layout manager to implicitly size and
 * position it by "allocating" an area for an actor. This allows for
 * actors to be manipulate in both a fixed or static parent container
 * (i.e. children of #ClutterGroup) and a more automatic or dynamic
 * layout based parent container.
 *
 * When accessing the position and size of an actor, the simple accessors
 * like clutter_actor_get_width() and clutter_actor_get_x() will return
 * a value depending on whether the actor has been explicitly sized and
 * positioned by the developer or implicitly by the layout manager.
 *
 * Depending on whether you are querying an actor or implementing a
 * layout manager, you should either use the simple accessors or use the
 * size negotiation API.
 *
 * Clutter actors are also able to receive input events and react to
 * them. Events are handled in the following ways:
 *
 * <orderedlist>
 *   <listitem><para>Actors emit pointer events if set reactive, see
 *   clutter_actor_set_reactive()</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>The stage is always reactive</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Events are handled by connecting signal handlers to
 *   the numerous event signal types.</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Event handlers must return %TRUE if they handled
 *   the event and wish to block the event emission chain, or %FALSE
 *   if the emission chain must continue</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Keyboard events are emitted if actor has focus, see
 *   clutter_stage_set_key_focus()</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Motion events (motion, enter, leave) are not emitted
 *   if clutter_set_motion_events_enabled() is called with %FALSE.
 *   See clutter_set_motion_events_enabled() documentation for more
 *   information.</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Once emitted, an event emission chain has two
 *   phases: capture and bubble. An emitted event starts in the capture
 *   phase (see ClutterActor::captured-event) beginning at the stage and
 *   traversing every child actor until the event source actor is reached.
 *   The emission then enters the bubble phase, traversing back up the
 *   chain via parents until it reaches the stage. Any event handler can
 *   abort this chain by returning %TRUE (meaning "event handled").
 *   </para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Pointer events will 'pass through' non reactive
 *   overlapping actors.</para></listitem>
 * </orderedlist>
 *
 * <figure id="event-flow">
 *   <title>Event flow in Clutter</title>
 *   <graphic fileref="event-flow.png" format="PNG"/>
 * </figure>
 *
 * Every '?' box in the diagram above is an entry point for application
 * code.
 *
 * For implementing a new custom actor class, please read <link
 * linkend="clutter-subclassing-ClutterActor">the corresponding section</link>
 * of the API reference.

 * @y: (in): y screen coordinate of the point to unproject
 * @x_out: (out): return location for the unprojected x coordinance
 * @y_out: (out): return location for the unprojected y coordinance
 *
 * This function translates screen coordinates (@x, @y) to
 * coordinates relative to the actor. For example, it can be used to translate
 * screen events from global screen coordinates into actor-local coordinates.
 *
 * The conversion can fail, notably if the transform stack results in the
 * actor being projected on the screen as a mere line.
 *
 * The conversion should not be expected to be pixel-perfect due to the
 * nature of the operation. In general the error grows when the skewing
 * of the actor rectangle on screen increases.
 *
 * Note: This function is fairly computationally intensive.
 *
 * Note: This function only works when the allocation is up-to-date,
 * i.e. inside of paint()
